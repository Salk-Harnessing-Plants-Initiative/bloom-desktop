## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Idle Session Timeout

The system SHALL implement an idle timer in the main process that resets session state after a configurable period of inactivity to prevent scan misattribution in shared lab environments.

#### Scenario: Session resets after 10 minutes of inactivity

- **GIVEN** a phenotyper has selected their identity and experiment
- **AND** no scanning activity occurs for 10 minutes
- **WHEN** the idle timeout expires
- **THEN** the session state SHALL be reset (phenotyperId, experimentId, waveNumber, plantAgeDays, accessionName set to null)
- **AND** the renderer SHALL be notified via a `session:idle-reset` event

#### Scenario: Timer resets on session changes

- **GIVEN** the idle timer is running
- **AND** at least one session field is non-null
- **WHEN** the user changes phenotyper or experiment selection (triggering `session:set`)
- **THEN** the idle timer SHALL restart from zero

#### Scenario: Timer does not reset on session:set when no session data exists

- **GIVEN** the idle timer is running
- **AND** no session data has been set (all fields are null)
- **WHEN** `session:set` is called with a partial update
- **THEN** the idle timer SHALL NOT be reset

#### Scenario: Timer resets on scanner initialization

- **GIVEN** the idle timer is running
- **WHEN** the scanner is initialized (triggering `scanner:initialize`)
- **THEN** the idle timer SHALL restart from zero

#### Scenario: Timer does not fire during active scan

- **GIVEN** the idle timer is running
- **AND** a scan is in progress (`scanner:scan` has been called)
- **WHEN** the configured timeout elapses
- **THEN** the idle timer SHALL NOT fire
- **AND** the timer SHALL resume only after the scan completes or errors

#### Scenario: Timer does not reset on non-activity events

- **GIVEN** the idle timer is running
- **WHEN** IPC events other than `session:set`, `scanner:initialize`, or `scanner:scan` are received (e.g., `scanner:status`, `camera:get-status`, page navigation)
- **THEN** the idle timer SHALL NOT restart
- **AND** the timer SHALL continue counting down from its current position

#### Scenario: Idle timeout is a no-op when no session is active

- **GIVEN** no phenotyper or experiment has been selected (all session fields are null)
- **WHEN** the idle timeout expires
- **THEN** `resetSessionState()` SHALL NOT be called
- **AND** no `session:idle-reset` event SHALL be sent to the renderer

#### Scenario: Idle callback fires exactly once per timeout cycle

- **GIVEN** the idle timer has been started
- **WHEN** the timeout elapses
- **THEN** the `onIdle` callback SHALL fire exactly once
- **AND** SHALL NOT fire again unless the timer is explicitly restarted via `start()` or `resetTimer()`

### Requirement: Configurable Idle Timeout Duration

The idle timeout duration SHALL be configurable programmatically (e.g., for unit tests) with a default value of 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds). The timeout is not configurable at runtime via environment variables or user settings.

#### Scenario: Default timeout is 10 minutes

- **GIVEN** no custom timeout is configured
- **WHEN** the idle timer is created
- **THEN** the timeout SHALL default to 600,000 milliseconds (10 minutes)

#### Scenario: Custom timeout value is respected

- **GIVEN** a positive finite `timeoutMs` value is passed to the constructor
- **WHEN** the idle timer is created with the custom value
- **THEN** the timer SHALL use the configured duration instead of the default

#### Scenario: Invalid timeout value is rejected

- **GIVEN** a non-positive, non-finite, or NaN `timeoutMs` value is passed
- **WHEN** the idle timer constructor is called
- **THEN** the constructor SHALL throw a `RangeError`

### Requirement: Idle Reset User Notification

The system SHALL visibly notify the user when a session is reset due to inactivity so they understand why their selections were cleared.

#### Scenario: User sees notification after idle reset

- **GIVEN** the idle timeout has expired
- **WHEN** the session state is reset
- **THEN** the renderer SHALL display a visible notification to the user
- **AND** the notification SHALL indicate the reset was due to inactivity
- **AND** the phenotyper and experiment dropdowns SHALL show their empty/placeholder state

#### Scenario: Notification is dismissed when next scan starts

- **GIVEN** the idle reset notification banner is visible
- **WHEN** the user fills all required fields and starts a new scan
- **THEN** the notification banner SHALL no longer be visible
- **AND** the scan SHALL proceed normally

#### Scenario: Idle reset does not affect UI during an active scan

- **GIVEN** a scan is actively in progress in the renderer (`isScanning` is true)
- **WHEN** a `session:idle-reset` IPC event is received
- **THEN** the renderer SHALL NOT clear metadata state
- **AND** the idle reset notification banner SHALL NOT be shown

#### Scenario: Notification enumerates all cleared fields and the timeout duration

Scientists need to know both what was cleared and why, so they can plan workflows around the threshold
(e.g., pausing between scans for sample preparation).

- **GIVEN** the idle timeout has expired and the session state has been reset
- **WHEN** the renderer shows the notification banner
- **THEN** the notification text SHALL reference all cleared fields: phenotyper, experiment, wave number, plant age, accession name, and plant QR code
- **AND** the notification text SHALL state the idle timeout duration (10 minutes)

#### Scenario: Banner shown on CaptureScan mount after navigation-away idle reset

- **GIVEN** an idle reset occurred while the user was navigated away from CaptureScan
- **WHEN** the user navigates back to CaptureScan (component mounts)
- **THEN** the idle reset notification banner SHALL be displayed
- **AND** the form fields SHALL be in their empty/placeholder state

#### Scenario: On-mount idle reset detection clears form fields

The `onIdleReset` IPC handler clears metadata fields and shows the banner. The on-mount
`checkIdleReset()` path must produce identical UI state so both code paths are consistent,
regardless of whether the user was on CaptureScan when the idle reset fired.

- **GIVEN** `window.electron.session.checkIdleReset` resolves `true` on mount (idle reset flag was set)
- **WHEN** CaptureScan mounts and the `checkIdleReset()` promise resolves
- **THEN** the component SHALL clear all metadata form fields (phenotyper, experiment, wave number, plant age, plant QR code, accession name) to empty
- **AND** SHALL show the idle reset notification banner

#### Scenario: Explicit session reset clears the idle-reset notification flag

When the user explicitly resets the session, any pending idle-reset notification flag from a prior
idle reset (that fired while the user was navigated away) is no longer meaningful and must be cleared
so CaptureScan does not show a stale banner on the next mount.

- **GIVEN** an idle reset has occurred while the user was navigated away (`wasIdleResetFlag` is set)
- **AND** the `onIdleReset` IPC listener never fired because CaptureScan was unmounted
- **WHEN** the user explicitly triggers a `session:reset` IPC call
- **THEN** `consumeIdleResetFlag()` SHALL return `false` on the next call
- **AND** a subsequent mount of CaptureScan SHALL NOT show the idle reset banner

#### Scenario: isScanningRef updated synchronously on scan start

The `onIdleReset` IPC listener is registered once with empty deps and reads `isScanningRef.current`
to guard against clearing metadata during an active scan. Because the main process calls
`pauseForScan()` before a scan starts, this guard is defense-in-depth against in-flight IPC
messages queued before the pause. Setting the ref synchronously before any `await` in
`handleStartScan` closes the window between `setIsScanning(true)` (which schedules a React state
update) and the `useEffect([isScanning])` flush that mirrors it into the ref.

- **GIVEN** CaptureScan has an `onIdleReset` listener registered with empty-dependency `useEffect`
- **AND** the listener reads `isScanningRef.current` to guard against clearing metadata during a scan
- **WHEN** `handleStartScan` is called
- **THEN** `isScanningRef.current` SHALL be set to `true` synchronously as the first statement of `handleStartScan` (before any `await`)

#### Scenario: Mount-time checkIdleReset call does not setState after component unmounts

- **GIVEN** CaptureScan mounts and immediately issues a `checkIdleReset()` IPC call
- **AND** the component unmounts before `checkIdleReset()` resolves (e.g., rapid navigation)
- **WHEN** the `checkIdleReset()` promise resolves with any value
- **THEN** `setShowIdleResetBanner` SHALL NOT be called
- **AND** no setState-on-unmounted-component side-effect SHALL occur
