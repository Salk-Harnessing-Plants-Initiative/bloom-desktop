## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Numeric Field Input Behavior

Numeric input fields (Wave Number, Plant Age) SHALL allow users to clear the field and type new values directly, matching standard HTML number input behavior.

#### Scenario: User clears Wave Number field to type new value

- **GIVEN** the user is on the Capture Scan page
- **AND** the Wave Number field contains a value (e.g., "5")
- **WHEN** the user selects all text and deletes it
- **THEN** the field SHALL become empty (not reset to 0)
- **AND** the user SHALL be able to type a new value directly
- **AND** a validation error SHALL appear indicating the field is required

#### Scenario: User clears Plant Age field to type new value

- **GIVEN** the user is on the Capture Scan page
- **AND** the Plant Age field contains a value (e.g., "14")
- **WHEN** the user selects all text and deletes it
- **THEN** the field SHALL become empty (not reset to 0)
- **AND** the user SHALL be able to type a new value directly
- **AND** a validation error SHALL appear indicating the field is required

### Requirement: Numeric Field Integer Validation

Wave Number and Plant Age fields SHALL only accept non-negative integers (whole numbers including 0). Non-integer values SHALL display a validation error to inform the user.

#### Scenario: Decimal values show validation error

- **GIVEN** the user is on the Capture Scan page
- **WHEN** the user enters a decimal value (e.g., "1.5") in Wave Number
- **THEN** a validation error SHALL appear: "Wave number must be a whole number"
- **AND** the Start Scan button SHALL be disabled

#### Scenario: Decimal Plant Age shows validation error

- **GIVEN** the user is on the Capture Scan page
- **WHEN** the user enters a decimal value (e.g., "14.5") in Plant Age
- **THEN** a validation error SHALL appear: "Plant age must be a whole number"
- **AND** the Start Scan button SHALL be disabled

#### Scenario: Integer values are accepted

- **GIVEN** the user is on the Capture Scan page
- **WHEN** the user enters a whole number (e.g., "0", "1", "14") in Wave Number or Plant Age
- **THEN** the value SHALL be accepted without error

### Requirement: Wave Number Zero Validation

Wave Number SHALL accept 0 as a valid value, matching the pilot application behavior.

#### Scenario: Wave Number of 0 is valid

- **GIVEN** the user is on the Capture Scan page
- **AND** all other required fields are filled correctly
- **WHEN** the user enters "0" in the Wave Number field
- **THEN** no validation error SHALL appear for Wave Number
- **AND** the Start Scan button SHALL be enabled (assuming other requirements met)

#### Scenario: Wave Number of negative value is invalid

- **GIVEN** the user is on the Capture Scan page
- **WHEN** the user enters a negative number in the Wave Number field
- **THEN** a validation error SHALL appear: "Wave number must be 0 or greater"
- **AND** the Start Scan button SHALL be disabled

#### Scenario: Empty Wave Number is invalid
