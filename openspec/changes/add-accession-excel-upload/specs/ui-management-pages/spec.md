## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Excel File Upload for Accessions

The Accessions page SHALL provide drag-and-drop Excel file upload functionality for bulk-creating plant-to-genotype mappings with visual column mapping and preview.

#### Scenario: Drag and Drop File Upload

**Given** the user is on the `/accessions` page
**When** the user drags an Excel file (XLSX or XLS) into the upload zone
**Then** the file is accepted and parsed
**And** a loading indicator appears during parsing
**And** the sheet selector becomes visible (if multiple sheets)
**And** the column mapping interface appears

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Upload zone has clear visual indication (dashed border)
- Accepted file types: .xlsx, .xls
- File type validation with user-friendly error message
- Loading state while parsing file

#### Scenario: File Size Validation

**Given** the user is on the `/accessions` page
**When** the user uploads an Excel file larger than 15MB
**Then** an error message appears indicating the file is too large
**And** the file is rejected
**And** the user is advised to split the file into smaller parts

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Maximum file size: 15MB
- Clear error message: "File size exceeds 15MB. Please split into smaller files."
- Upload zone remains available for retry

#### Scenario: Sheet Selection for Multi-Sheet Files

**Given** the user has uploaded an Excel file with multiple sheets
**When** the file is parsed
**Then** a dropdown appears showing all sheet names
**And** the first sheet is selected by default
**And** the preview table shows data from the selected sheet

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Sheet dropdown only visible when file has multiple sheets
- Changing sheet updates the preview and resets column selections
- Column headers extracted from first row of selected sheet

#### Scenario: Column Mapping Selection

**Given** the user has uploaded an Excel file
**When** the preview interface is displayed
**Then** two dropdown selectors appear: "Plant ID (Barcode)" and "Genotype ID"
**And** each dropdown contains all column headers from the file
**And** the user must select both columns before uploading

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Both selectors start with "Select..." placeholder
- Columns can be selected in any order
- Same column cannot be selected for both fields
- Upload button disabled until both columns selected

#### Scenario: Visual Column Highlighting

**Given** the user has selected Plant ID and Genotype ID columns
**When** viewing the preview table
**Then** the Plant ID column is highlighted in green
**And** the Genotype ID column is highlighted in blue
**And** column headers show icons/labels indicating their mapping

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Green highlight (#BBF7D0 or similar) for Plant ID column
- Blue highlight (#BFDBFE or similar) for Genotype ID column
- Header row shows "Plant ID" and "Genotype ID" labels
- Highlighting updates immediately on selection change

#### Scenario: Preview Table Display

**Given** the user has uploaded an Excel file
**When** the preview interface is displayed
**Then** a table shows the first 20 data rows (excluding header)
**And** all columns from the sheet are visible
**And** the table is horizontally scrollable if columns exceed width

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Maximum 20 rows displayed in preview
- Header row always visible
- Table scrollable for wide spreadsheets
- Empty cells display as empty (not "undefined" or "null")

#### Scenario: Successful Upload with Batch Processing

**Given** the user has selected Plant ID and Genotype ID columns
**When** the user clicks the "Upload Accession File" button
**Then** a progress indicator appears showing upload status
**And** mappings are processed in batches of 100 rows
**And** a new accession is created with the file name
**And** all mappings are associated with the accession
**And** a success message appears when complete
**And** the accession list refreshes to show the new entry

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Progress indicator shows during upload
- Batch size: 100 rows per batch
- Uses existing `createWithMappings` IPC handler
- Accession name derived from file name
- Form resets after successful upload
- Success message: "Done uploading!" or similar

#### Scenario: Upload Error Handling

**Given** the user is uploading an Excel file
**When** the upload fails (network error, database error)
**Then** an error message appears indicating the failure
**And** the form remains populated for retry
**And** the user can attempt the upload again

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Error message is user-friendly (not raw error)
- Form state preserved on error
- Retry possible without re-uploading file

#### Scenario: Invalid File Type

**Given** the user is on the `/accessions` page
**When** the user attempts to upload a non-Excel file (e.g., .csv, .pdf, .txt)
**Then** the file is rejected
**And** an error message indicates only Excel files are accepted

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Only .xlsx and .xls files accepted
- Clear error message for invalid file types
- Upload zone remains available for retry
