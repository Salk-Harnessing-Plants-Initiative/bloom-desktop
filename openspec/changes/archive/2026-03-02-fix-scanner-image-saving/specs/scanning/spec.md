## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Scanner Image Persistence

The Scanner SHALL save captured frames to disk during the scanning workflow, creating the output directory if needed and naming files with 3-digit zero-padded frame numbers matching the pilot implementation.

#### Scenario: Output directory created automatically

- **GIVEN** the scanner is initialized with `output_path` set to a non-existent directory
- **WHEN** `perform_scan()` is called
- **THEN** the output directory SHALL be created before capturing begins
- **AND** parent directories SHALL be created recursively if needed

#### Scenario: Images saved as PNG files with pilot-compatible naming

- **GIVEN** the scanner is capturing frames during `perform_scan()`
- **WHEN** a frame is successfully captured via `grab_frame()`
- **THEN** the frame SHALL be saved as a PNG file in the output directory
- **AND** the filename SHALL follow the pattern `NNN.png` where NNN is 3-digit zero-padded frame number (1-indexed)
- **AND** this matches pilot format: `pylon.py:62` uses `f'{i + 1:03d}.png'`

#### Scenario: All captured frames persisted

- **GIVEN** a scan with `num_frames` set to 72
- **WHEN** `perform_scan()` completes successfully
- **THEN** 72 PNG files SHALL exist in the output directory
- **AND** files SHALL be named `001.png` through `072.png`
- **AND** each file SHALL contain the image data from the corresponding frame capture

#### Scenario: Frame count matches file count

- **GIVEN** `perform_scan()` returns `ScanResult` with `frames_captured = N`
- **THEN** exactly N image files SHALL exist in `output_path`
- **AND** database Image records created by `scanner-process.ts` SHALL reference these files

### Requirement: Cross-Platform Path Handling

The Scanner SHALL use `pathlib.Path` with `.as_posix()` for all file path operations to ensure consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Scenario: File paths use POSIX format

- **GIVEN** the scanner is saving images on any operating system
- **WHEN** file paths are constructed for image saving
- **THEN** paths SHALL be created using `pathlib.Path`
- **AND** paths SHALL be converted using `.as_posix()` for file I/O operations
- **AND** this ensures forward slashes are used consistently across platforms

#### Scenario: Image files are readable after saving

- **GIVEN** an image has been saved using `.as_posix()` path
- **WHEN** the image file is read back
- **THEN** the file SHALL be readable via `imageio`
- **AND** the image data SHALL match the original captured frame

### Requirement: Scanner-Process Frame Number Extraction

The scanner-process.ts SHALL extract frame numbers from filenames using the pilot-compatible format and use them directly as 1-indexed database values.

#### Scenario: Frame number extracted from 3-digit filename

- **GIVEN** an image file named `001.png`
- **WHEN** scanner-process.ts parses the filename
- **THEN** frame_number SHALL be set to 1 (extracted directly, no conversion needed)
- **AND** this matches pilot database convention (1-indexed frame numbers)
