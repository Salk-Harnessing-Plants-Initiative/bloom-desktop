## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Scan Metadata JSON File

The system SHALL write a `metadata.json` file to the scan output directory BEFORE image capture begins. The file SHALL contain all scan metadata fields so that scan data is self-describing and portable without requiring the SQLite database. The file SHALL include a `metadata_version` field for forward-compatible schema evolution.

#### Scenario: metadata.json written before image capture

- **GIVEN** the user starts a scan with valid metadata
- **WHEN** the scanner process begins the scan workflow
- **THEN** a `metadata.json` file SHALL be written to the scan output directory
- **AND** the file SHALL be written BEFORE the Python scan command is sent
- **AND** the file SHALL exist on disk before any image files are created

#### Scenario: metadata.json contains all scan metadata fields

- **GIVEN** a scan is started with experiment, phenotyper, plant, and camera metadata
- **WHEN** `metadata.json` is written
- **THEN** the file SHALL contain the following fields: `metadata_version`, `experiment_id`, `phenotyper_id`, `scanner_name`, `plant_id`, `capture_date`, `num_frames`, `exposure_time`, `gain`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `gamma`, `seconds_per_rot`, `wave_number`, `plant_age_days`
- **AND** optional fields (`accession_name`, `scan_path`) SHALL be included when provided
- **AND** `metadata_version` SHALL be set to `1` for the current schema

#### Scenario: ISO 8601 timestamp for capture_date

- **GIVEN** a scan is started
- **WHEN** `metadata.json` is written
- **THEN** the `capture_date` field SHALL be an ISO 8601 formatted string (e.g., `"2026-03-05T14:30:00.000Z"`)

#### Scenario: metadata.json is valid JSON with trailing newline

- **GIVEN** `metadata.json` has been written to a scan directory
- **WHEN** the file is read and parsed with `JSON.parse()`
- **THEN** parsing SHALL succeed without errors
- **AND** the content SHALL be formatted with 2-space indentation for human readability
- **AND** the file SHALL end with a trailing newline character (`\n`) per POSIX convention

#### Scenario: scan_path prefers relative path for portability

- **GIVEN** the scan metadata includes both a relative `scan_path` and an absolute `output_path`
- **WHEN** `metadata.json` is written
- **THEN** `scan_path` SHALL use the relative path from `metadata.scan_path`
- **AND** SHALL fall back to `settings.output_path` only when `metadata.scan_path` is not set
- **AND** consumers SHOULD expect either a relative or absolute path

#### Scenario: num_frames uses top-level setting when available

- **GIVEN** `settings.num_frames` is set to 72 and `settings.daq.num_frames` is set to 36
- **WHEN** `buildMetadataObject` constructs the metadata
- **THEN** `num_frames` SHALL be 72 (top-level value takes precedence)

### Requirement: Atomic Metadata File Write

The system SHALL use an atomic write pattern for `metadata.json` to prevent partial or corrupt files in case of interruption. Stale temporary files from previous failed writes SHALL be cleaned up.

#### Scenario: Write to temporary file then rename

- **GIVEN** the system is writing `metadata.json` to a scan directory
- **WHEN** the write operation is performed
- **THEN** the content SHALL first be written to a temporary file (`metadata.json.tmp`)
- **AND** the temporary file SHALL then be renamed to `metadata.json`
- **AND** the rename operation SHALL be atomic on the filesystem

#### Scenario: No temporary file remains after successful write

- **GIVEN** `metadata.json` has been successfully written
- **WHEN** the scan directory is inspected
- **THEN** only `metadata.json` SHALL exist (no `metadata.json.tmp`)

#### Scenario: Stale temporary file cleaned up before write

- **GIVEN** a stale `metadata.json.tmp` file exists from a previous failed write
- **WHEN** a new `metadata.json` write is initiated
- **THEN** the stale `.tmp` file SHALL be removed before the new write begins
- **AND** the new `metadata.json` SHALL be written successfully
