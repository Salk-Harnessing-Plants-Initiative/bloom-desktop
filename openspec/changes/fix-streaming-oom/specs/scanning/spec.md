## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Streaming Frame Encoding

The camera streaming pipeline SHALL encode preview frames as JPEG (quality 85) with `data:image/jpeg;base64,...` data URIs. This applies to both mock and real camera implementations via `grab_frame_base64()`. The single-frame `capture` action SHALL remain PNG to preserve lossless quality for diagnostic use. Scan capture (disk-saved images via `grab_frames()` + `iio.imwrite()`) SHALL remain unaffected and continue using lossless formats.

JPEG quality 85 is adequate for exposure/gain tuning: it introduces ~0.8% quantization error (+/-2 intensity levels on 8-bit grayscale), well below the threshold where a scientist would choose a materially different exposure setting. Highlight/shadow clipping remains clearly visible.

#### Scenario: Mock camera streams JPEG frames

- **GIVEN** the mock camera is configured and streaming is started
- **WHEN** `grab_frame_base64()` is called
- **THEN** the returned data URI SHALL start with `data:image/jpeg;base64,`
- **AND** the decoded image SHALL be valid JPEG
- **AND** the base64 payload size SHALL be less than 500 KB

#### Scenario: Real camera encodes streaming frames as JPEG

- **GIVEN** a 2048×1080 grayscale numpy array from a Basler camera
- **WHEN** `Camera._img_to_base64()` encodes the frame
- **THEN** the output SHALL be JPEG-encoded at quality 85
- **AND** the decoded image SHALL be valid JPEG with mode "L" (grayscale)

#### Scenario: Grayscale image preserved through JPEG encoding

- **GIVEN** a grayscale (mode "L") numpy array
- **WHEN** encoded to JPEG via `_img_to_base64()` and decoded back
- **THEN** the decoded image SHALL have mode "L" (single channel grayscale)
- **AND** the decoded image dimensions SHALL match the input

#### Scenario: Single-frame capture remains PNG

- **GIVEN** the camera is configured
- **WHEN** a single-frame capture is requested via the `capture` IPC command
- **THEN** the returned data URI SHALL start with `data:image/png;base64,`
- **AND** the lossless PNG contract SHALL be preserved

#### Scenario: Scan capture is not affected

- **GIVEN** a scan is in progress via `scanner.scan()`
- **WHEN** frames are captured to disk via `grab_frames()` and saved via `iio.imwrite()`
- **THEN** images SHALL be saved as lossless PNG files
- **AND** the streaming JPEG encoding SHALL NOT be used for disk writes

### Requirement: Stdout Buffer Efficiency

The `PythonProcess.handleStdout` method SHALL use an array-based buffer (accumulating `Buffer` chunks in an array) instead of string concatenation to reassemble newline-delimited protocol messages from the Python subprocess stdout. This is a behavior-preserving refactor that prevents O(n²) intermediate string allocations when processing large payloads (e.g., base64-encoded frames).

#### Scenario: Large frame payload does not cause excessive allocations

- **GIVEN** the Python subprocess sends a FRAME: message of ~270 KB (JPEG base64)
- **AND** Node receives it as multiple ~64 KB stdout chunks
- **WHEN** `handleStdout` reassembles the chunks into a complete line
- **THEN** the buffer SHALL accumulate `Buffer` objects in an array
- **AND** the method SHALL call `Buffer.concat()` and `toString()` only once when a complete line (newline) is found

#### Scenario: Small protocol messages still work correctly

- **GIVEN** the Python subprocess sends a STATUS: message of ~50 bytes
- **WHEN** `handleStdout` processes the chunk
- **THEN** the message SHALL be parsed and emitted correctly
- **AND** behavior SHALL be identical to the previous string-concatenation approach

#### Scenario: Multi-line chunks are handled correctly

- **GIVEN** a single stdout chunk contains multiple complete lines (e.g., STATUS: followed by FRAME:)
- **WHEN** `handleStdout` processes the chunk
- **THEN** each complete line SHALL be parsed and emitted separately
- **AND** any trailing incomplete line SHALL be retained in the buffer for the next chunk

#### Scenario: Empty stdout chunks are handled safely

- **GIVEN** Node emits a zero-length data event from the child process stdout
- **WHEN** `handleStdout` receives the empty Buffer
- **THEN** the method SHALL not emit any lines
- **AND** the buffer state SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Buffer cleared on process stop

- **GIVEN** the Python process is stopped or exits
- **WHEN** `stop()` is called on the PythonProcess
- **THEN** the stdout buffer SHALL be cleared
- **AND** no partial data from the previous session SHALL persist
