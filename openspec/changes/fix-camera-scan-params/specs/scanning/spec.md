## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Scanner Image Persistence

The Scanner SHALL save captured frames to disk during the scanning workflow, creating the output directory if needed and naming files with 3-digit zero-padded frame numbers matching the pilot implementation.

#### Scenario: Output directory created automatically

- **GIVEN** the scanner is initialized with `output_path` set to a non-existent directory
- **WHEN** `perform_scan()` is called
- **THEN** the output directory SHALL be created before capturing begins
- **AND** parent directories SHALL be created recursively if needed

#### Scenario: Images saved as PNG files with pilot-compatible naming

- **GIVEN** the scanner is capturing frames during `perform_scan()`
- **WHEN** a frame is successfully captured via `grab_frame()`
- **THEN** the frame SHALL be saved as a PNG file in the output directory
- **AND** the filename SHALL follow the pattern `NNN.png` where NNN is 3-digit zero-padded frame number (1-indexed)
- **AND** this matches pilot format: `pylon.py:62` uses `f'{i + 1:03d}.png'`

#### Scenario: All captured frames persisted

- **GIVEN** a scan with `num_frames` configured via Machine Configuration (default 72)
- **WHEN** `perform_scan()` completes successfully
- **THEN** the configured number of PNG files SHALL exist in the output directory
- **AND** files SHALL be named `001.png` through `{num_frames:03d}.png`
- **AND** each file SHALL contain the image data from the corresponding frame capture

#### Scenario: Frame count matches file count

- **GIVEN** `perform_scan()` returns `ScanResult` with `frames_captured = N`
- **THEN** exactly N image files SHALL exist in `output_path`
- **AND** database Image records created by `scanner-process.ts` SHALL reference these files

### Requirement: Scan Metadata JSON File

The system SHALL write a `metadata.json` file to the scan output directory BEFORE image capture begins. The file SHALL contain all scan metadata fields so that scan data is self-describing and portable without requiring the SQLite database. The file SHALL include a `metadata_version` field for forward-compatible schema evolution.

#### Scenario: metadata.json written before image capture

- **GIVEN** the user starts a scan with valid metadata
- **WHEN** the scanner process begins the scan workflow
- **THEN** a `metadata.json` file SHALL be written to the scan output directory
- **AND** the file SHALL be written BEFORE the Python scan command is sent
- **AND** the file SHALL exist on disk before any image files are created

#### Scenario: metadata.json contains all scan metadata fields

- **GIVEN** a scan is started with experiment, phenotyper, plant, and camera metadata
- **WHEN** `metadata.json` is written
- **THEN** the file SHALL contain the following fields: `metadata_version`, `experiment_id`, `phenotyper_id`, `scanner_name`, `plant_id`, `capture_date`, `num_frames`, `exposure_time`, `gain`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `gamma`, `seconds_per_rot`, `wave_number`, `plant_age_days`
- **AND** `brightness` SHALL default to 0 and `contrast` SHALL default to 0 (Basler identity values; these parameters are not supported on the acA2000-50gm)
- **AND** optional fields (`accession_name`, `scan_path`) SHALL be included when provided
- **AND** `metadata_version` SHALL be set to `1` for the current schema

#### Scenario: ISO 8601 timestamp for capture_date

- **GIVEN** a scan is started
- **WHEN** `metadata.json` is written
- **THEN** the `capture_date` field SHALL be an ISO 8601 formatted string (e.g., `"2026-03-05T14:30:00.000Z"`)

#### Scenario: metadata.json is valid JSON with trailing newline

- **GIVEN** `metadata.json` has been written to a scan directory
- **WHEN** the file is read and parsed with `JSON.parse()`
- **THEN** parsing SHALL succeed without errors
- **AND** the content SHALL be formatted with 2-space indentation for human readability
- **AND** the file SHALL end with a trailing newline character (`\n`) per POSIX convention

#### Scenario: scan_path prefers relative path for portability

- **GIVEN** the scan metadata includes both a relative `scan_path` and an absolute `output_path`
- **WHEN** `metadata.json` is written
- **THEN** `scan_path` SHALL use the relative path from `metadata.scan_path`
- **AND** SHALL fall back to `settings.output_path` only when `metadata.scan_path` is not set
- **AND** consumers SHOULD expect either a relative or absolute path

#### Scenario: num_frames uses top-level setting when available

- **GIVEN** `settings.num_frames` is provided and `settings.daq.num_frames` is also set
- **WHEN** `buildMetadataObject` constructs the metadata
- **THEN** `num_frames` SHALL use the top-level value (which originates from Machine Configuration)
