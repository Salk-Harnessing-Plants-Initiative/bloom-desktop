# scanning Specification

## Purpose

TBD - created by archiving change fix-scanner-event-listener-leak. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Scanner Event Listener Lifecycle

Scanner event listeners SHALL be properly cleaned up when component unmounts or dependencies change to prevent memory leaks and duplicate event handling.

#### Scenario: Event listeners return cleanup functions

- **GIVEN** the scanner API is available
- **WHEN** a component registers event listeners using `onProgress`, `onComplete`, or `onError`
- **THEN** each listener registration SHALL return a cleanup function
- **AND** calling the cleanup function SHALL remove the specific listener
- **AND** the cleanup function SHALL follow the same pattern as `camera.onFrame`

#### Scenario: Component cleanup on unmount

- **GIVEN** a component has registered scanner event listeners
- **WHEN** the component unmounts
- **THEN** all registered listeners SHALL be automatically removed
- **AND** no event handlers SHALL fire after unmount
- **AND** no memory leaks SHALL occur

#### Scenario: Component cleanup on dependency change

- **GIVEN** a useEffect has registered scanner event listeners
- **AND** the useEffect has dependencies
- **WHEN** any dependency value changes
- **THEN** all listeners from the previous effect SHALL be removed
- **AND** new listeners SHALL be registered with current dependency values
- **AND** only ONE set of listeners SHALL be active at any time

#### Scenario: Single scan completion event

- **GIVEN** a user starts a scan
- **AND** the user has typed in the Plant QR Code field multiple times
- **WHEN** the scan completes successfully
- **THEN** exactly ONE `onComplete` event SHALL fire
- **AND** exactly ONE scan entry SHALL be added to the recent scans list
- **AND** the scan SHALL appear exactly once in the UI

### Requirement: Interval Cleanup

useEffect hooks that create intervals or timers SHALL clean them up when dependencies change or component unmounts.

#### Scenario: Polling interval cleanup

- **GIVEN** a useEffect creates an interval for polling
- **WHEN** the component unmounts
- **THEN** the interval SHALL be cleared
- **AND** no polling SHALL continue after unmount

#### Scenario: Polling interval cleanup on dependency change

- **GIVEN** a useEffect with an interval and dependencies
- **WHEN** any dependency changes
- **THEN** the previous interval SHALL be cleared
- **AND** a new interval SHALL be created with current dependency values
- **AND** only ONE interval SHALL be active at any time
