# Bloom Desktop Database Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: This .env file is ONLY used by Prisma CLI tools (studio, migrate, etc.)
# It is NOT used by the application at runtime!
#
# Database paths are determined at runtime by src/main/database.ts:
# - Development: ./prisma/dev.db (when NODE_ENV=development)
# - Production: ~/.bloom/data/bloom.db (when NODE_ENV=production)
# - Tests: ./prisma/test-*.db (temporary test databases)
#
# This variable is only for Prisma CLI commands like:
# - npx prisma studio (database browser)
# - npx prisma migrate dev (create migrations)
# - npx prisma db push (development schema sync)

BLOOM_DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
