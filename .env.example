# Bloom Desktop Environment Configuration
#
# Multiple .env files are used for different purposes:
# - .env (this file): Prisma CLI tools only (studio, migrate, etc.)
# - .env.e2e: E2E test configuration (loaded by Playwright)
#
# IMPORTANT: This .env file is ONLY used by Prisma CLI tools!
# It is NOT used by the application at runtime!
#
# Database paths are determined at runtime by src/main/database.ts:
# - Development: ./prisma/dev.db (when NODE_ENV=development)
# - Production: ~/.bloom/data/bloom.db (when NODE_ENV=production)
# - E2E Tests: ./tests/e2e/test.db (from .env.e2e)
#
# This variable is only for Prisma CLI commands like:
# - npx prisma studio (database browser)
# - npx prisma migrate dev (create migrations)
# - npx prisma db push (development schema sync)

BLOOM_DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# E2E Testing Configuration
# See .env.e2e for E2E test environment variables
# E2E tests use a separate database to avoid interfering with development data
